# Platform-Protocol-Place-
Platform Protocol Place is an intervention that occurs over the radio spectrum, specifically by engaging with IEEE 802.11 standards and protocols -  more commonly referred to as Wi-Fi technology. Platform Protocol Place transmits multiple Service Set Identifiers (SSID) simultaneously over a wireless local area network. An SSID is the name given to a Wi-Fi network so that a user can identify and connect to it â€“ to  experience the work the viewer must use their own devices to observe the different network names.

Platform Protocol Place uses code from the [ESP8266 Beacon Spam ](https://github.com/spacehuhn/esp8266_beaconSpam)
